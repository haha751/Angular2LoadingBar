Angular 2 Loading Bar

Based on https://github.com/chieffancypants/angular-loading-bar and idea from
(@rodrigouroz) https://github.com/rodrigouroz 
[source from https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/2684]

Usage:

bootstrap(AppComponent, [ LoadingBar.LOADING_BAR_PROVIDERS ]);

root component set
directive: LoadingBar
and render &lt;loading-bar&gt;%lt;/loading-bar&gt; in template

Yes, this is not the best solution, but I don't have another at this moment
